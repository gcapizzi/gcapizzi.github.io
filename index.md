# Hi 👋 I'm Giuseppe!

**Email**: [g.capizzi@gmail.com](mailto:g.capizzi@gmail.com)\
**GitHub**: [github.com/gcapizzi](https://github.com/gcapizzi)

I'm a staff software engineer based in London, UK.
I am focused on **sustainable software development**: growing high quality, maintainable, well tested software is what I do best.
I have a solid grasp of software design principles and test driven development is an invaluable tool in my daily practice.

My experience in consulting has taught me what **high performing, agile teams** look like and how to be an effective **coach and mentor**.
I've worked with enterprise teams to upskill them, to improve their development processes, and to recruit new team members.
As a member of the [Codebar](https://codebar.io) community, I've spent hundreds of hours coaching people from underrepresented backgrounds.

**Go** is my main language these days, but I never stop exploring: I've worked with Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and played with C, JavaScript, Clojure, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin, Rust, and more.
I have spent the last 7 years working on Platform-as-a-Service products, learning a lot about [**containers**](https://github.com/gcapizzi/containers-study-path) and **Kubernetes**.

## Experience

### VMware
<span class="subtitle">Staff Engineer 1 ⬩ London, United Kingdom ⬩ April 2020–March 2024</span>

After the acquisition of Pivotal by [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) (now part of [Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/)), I joined [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com) to continue my work in R&D.

#### Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes

I was the [Execution Lead](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/ROLES.md) for the [Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes Working Group](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/working-groups/cf-on-k8s.md), focused on porting Cloud Foundry to the Kubernetes platform.
I was responsible for the team's priorities and technical direction on projects like [**Eirini**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/eirini) and [**Korifi**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi), a complete rewrite of the Cloud Foundry API on top of Kubernetes.
We achieved a [remarkable level of compatibility](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi/blob/v0.10.0/docs/api.md) with Cloud Foundry and made Korifi a viable solution for Cloud Foundry users who wish to move to Kubernetes.

#### Services Toolkit

[Services Toolkit](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Services-Toolkit-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/0.9/svc-tlk/overview.html) is a framework that enables users to manage their data services on [Tanzu Application Platform](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-platform), VMware's Kubernetes distribution.
I implemented out-of-the-box support for PostgreSQL, MySQL and RabbitMQ on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com).

### Pivotal
<span class="subtitle">Staff Software Engineer ⬩ London, United Kingdom ⬩ March 2015–April 2020</span>

Pivotal helped enterprises to transform the way they build software to be more lean and agile.
To do this, they offered both a renowned agile consultancy service, _Pivotal Labs_, and a multi-cloud platform as a service, _Pivotal Application Service_, based on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org).
I had the opportunity to work on both.

During my whole time at Pivotal, I was also heavily involved in the recruiting process, interviewing dozens of engineers for a range of engineering roles.

#### Pivotal Labs

I helped both startups and big enterprises to build digital products using a **lean and agile process**, from the inception to the deployment in production.
All our teams included product managers, designers and engineers, and all our projects started with a phase of discovery and research.
On the engineering side, we practiced **extreme programming**, focusing on pair programming, test-driven development and continuous integration.
I was a tech lead in two occasions, on teams of 4 and 8 people respectively.

#### Pivotal Application Service

I spent most of my time on [**Garden**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release), the Cloud Foundry container runtime.
I led a refactoring that made it possible to use [containerd](https://containerd.io) as the containerisation backend.

### XPeppers
<span class="subtitle">Software Developer ⬩ Milan, Italy ⬩ October 2012–February 2015</span>

XPeppers (now part of the [Claranet Group](https://www.claranet.com)) was a software consultancy focused on agile methodologies, extreme programming and DevOps.
I worked with various clients using the PHP and Ruby/Rails stacks.

### Facile.it
<span class="subtitle">Software Developer ⬩ Milan, Italy ⬩ April 2012–October 2012</span>

[Facile.it](https://facile.it) is the Italian leader price comparison website, covering everything from insurance policies to phone rates.
I worked mostly on internal tools, built on the LAMP stack.

## Education

### University of Bergamo – Faculty of Engineering
<span class="subtitle">Bergamo, Italy ⬩ September 2004–March 2012</span>

Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Engineering.
First-class honors degree equivalent (110/110 cum Laude).
