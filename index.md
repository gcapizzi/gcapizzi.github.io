# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Giuseppe!

**Email**: [g.capizzi@gmail.com](mailto:g.capizzi@gmail.com)\
**GitHub**: [github.com/gcapizzi](https://github.com/gcapizzi)

I'm a software engineer based in London, UK.
I am focused on **sustainable software development**: growing high quality, maintainable, well tested software is what I do best.
I have a solid grasp of software design principles and test driven development is an invaluable tool in my daily practice.

My experience in consulting has taught me what **high performing, agile teams** look like and how to be an effective **coach and mentor**.
I've worked with enterprise teams to upskill them, to improve their development processes, and to recruit new team members.
As a member of the [Codebar](https://codebar.io) community, I've spent hundreds of hours coaching people from underrepresented backgrounds.

**Go** is my main language these days, but I never stop exploring: I've worked with Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and played with C, JavaScript, Clojure, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin, Rust, and more.
I have spent the last 7 years working on Platform-as-a-Service products, learning a lot about [**containers**](https://github.com/gcapizzi/containers-study-path) and **Kubernetes**.

## Experience

### VMware
<span class="subtitle">Staff Engineer 1 â¬© London, United Kingdom â¬© April 2020â€“March 2024</span>

After the aquisition of Pivotal by [VMware](https://www.vmware.com), I joined [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu) to continue my work on R&amp;D in the Cloud Foundry space. 
In particular, I focused on the efforts to port Cloud Foundry to the Kubernetes platform.

I started on [**Eirini**](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-eirini/), an experimental adapter which allowed to integrate Kubernetes as the Cloud Foundry container orchestrator.
As the project technical product manager, I took care of the team's priorities and technical direction.

Eirini later merged into the [**Korifi**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi) project, a complete rewrite of the Cloud Foundry API on top of Kubernetes, developed by the [Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes Working Group](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/working-groups/cf-on-k8s.md).
I am currently the [Execution Lead](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/ROLES.md) for the working group, responsible for the working group's feature tracks: tracking, health, and execution.

### Pivotal
<span class="subtitle">Staff Software Engineer â¬© London, United Kingdom â¬© March 2015â€“April 2020</span>

[Pivotal](https://pivotal.io) (now part of [VMware](https://www.vmware.com)) helped enterprises to transform the way they build software to be more lean and agile.
To do this, they offered both a renowned agile consultancy service, _Pivotal Labs_, and a multi-cloud platform as a service, _Pivotal Application Service_, based on Cloud Foundry.
I had the opportunity to work on both.

As a **Pivotal Labs** engineer, I helped both startups and big enterprises to build digital products using a lean and agile process, from the inception to the deployment in production.
All our teams included product managers, designers and engineers, and all our projects started with a phase of discovery and research.
On the engineering side, we practiced extreme programming, focusing on pair programming, test-driven development and continuous integration.
I was a tech lead in two occasions, on teams of 4 and 8 people respectively.

Switching gears to R&amp;D, I worked on **Pivotal Application Service**, Pivotal's distribution of the Cloud Foundry platform as a service.
Most of my time was spent on [Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release), the Cloud Foundry container runtime.
This allowed me to acquire a deep knowledge of how Linux containers work.

During my whole time at Pivotal, I was heavily involved in the recruiting process, interviewing dozens of engineers for a range of engineering roles.

### XPeppers
<span class="subtitle">Software Developer â¬© Milan, Italy â¬© October 2012â€“February 2015</span>

[XPeppers](https://xpeppers.com), now part of the [Claranet Group](https://www.claranet.com), is a software consultancy focused on agile methodologies, extreme programming and DevOps.
I've spent most of my time there working on [Onebip](https://onebip.com), a global mobile payment platform with over 5 billion users in 70 countries, where I was in charge of developing and maintaining one of the crucial components of their service-oriented architecture, built on PHP and MongoDB.
I also developed a specialized Rails-based CMS which allows to quickly build digital content selling websites that use Onebip as their payment provider.

### Facile.it
<span class="subtitle">Software Developer â¬© Milan, Italy â¬© April 2012â€“October 2012</span>

[Facile.it](https://facile.it) the Italian leader price comparison website, covering everything from insurance policies to phone rates.
I've developed their internal business metrics panel, a key component to the business' decision making process, which collects data from different sources, including Google Analytics and reports from insurance companies.
I've also worked on the mobile versions of the mortgages and loans comparators.
