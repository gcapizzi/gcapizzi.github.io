        I'm a software engineer focused on sustainable software development: growing high quality, maintainable,
        well tested software is what I do best. I have a solid grasp of software design principles and test driven
        development is an invaluable tool in my daily practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience in consulting has taught me what high performing, agile teams look like and how to be an effective
        coach and mentor. I've worked with enterprise teams to upskill them, to improve their development processes, and
        to recruit new team members. As a member of the <a class="printable" href="https://codebar.io">Codebar</a>
        community, I've spent hundreds of hours coaching people from underrepresented backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Go is my main language these days, but I never stop exploring: I've worked with Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and
        played with C, JavaScript, Clojure, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin, Rust, and more. I am also interested in programming
        language theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have spent the last 3 years working on <a class="printable" href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org">Cloud
          Foundry</a>, an open source platform as a service, and learning a lot about the cloud native ecosystem in the
        process.

        <h3>Pivotal / VMware</h3>
        <span class="subtitle">Software Engineer â¬© London, United Kingdom â¬© March 2015â€“current</span>
        <p>
          <a class="printable" href="https://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a>, now part of <a class="printable"
            href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>, helps enterprises to transform the way they build software to be
          more lean and agile. To do this, they offer both a renowned agile consultancy service, <a class="printable"
            href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs"><i>Pivotal Labs</i></a>, and a multi-cloud platform as a service, <a
            class="printable" href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu"><i>VMware Tanzu</i></a>, based on Cloud Foundry. I
          have had the opportunity to work on both.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a <strong>Pivotal Labs</strong> engineer, I helped both startups and big enterprises to build digital
          products using a lean and agile process, from the inception to the deployment in production. All our teams
          included product managers, designers and engineers, and all our projects started with a phase of discovery
          and research. On the engineering side, we practiced extreme programming, focusing on pair programming,
          test-driven development and continuous integration. I was a tech lead in two occasions, on teams of 4 and 8
          people respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working on the <a class="printable"
            href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-service"><strong>VMware Tanzu Application Service</strong></a>,
          VMware's distribution of the Cloud Foundry platform as a service. I've contributed to different components of
          the platform:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a class=printable" href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore">BOSH Backup
                and Restore</a>, a backup and restore tool for <a class="printable" href="https://bosh.io">BOSH</a>
              deployments;
            </li>
            <li>
              <a class="printable" href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release">Garden</a>, the Cloud
              Foundry container runtime;
            </li>
            <li>
              <a class="printable" href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-eirini/">Eirini</a>, an effort to
              integrate Kubernetes as the Cloud Foundry container orchestrator.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          During my whole time at Pivotal/VMware, I've been heavily involved in the recruiting process, interviewing
          dozens of engineers for a range of engineering roles.
