<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer based in London, UK. I am focused on
<strong>sustainable software development</strong>: growing high quality,
maintainable, well tested software is what I do best. I have a solid
grasp of software design principles and test driven development is an
invaluable tool in my daily practice.</p>
<p>My experience in consulting has taught me what <strong>high
performing, agile teams</strong> look like and how to be an effective
<strong>coach and mentor</strong>. Iâ€™ve worked with enterprise teams to
upskill them, to improve their development processes, and to recruit new
team members. As a member of the <a
href="https://codebar.io">Codebar</a> community, Iâ€™ve spent hundreds of
hours coaching people from underrepresented backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>Go</strong> is my main language these days, but I never stop
exploring: Iâ€™ve worked with Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and played with C,
JavaScript, Clojure, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin, Rust, and more. I have
spent the last 7 years working on Platform-as-a-Service products,
learning a lot about <a

and <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Staff Engineer 1 â¬© Milan, Italy â¬© April
2020â€“current</span></p>
<p>After the aquisition of Pivotal by <a
href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>, I joined <a
href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu">VMware Tanzu</a> to continue my
work on R&amp;D in the Cloud Foundry space. In particular, I focused on
the efforts to port Cloud Foundry to the Kubernetes platform.</p>
<p>I started on <a
href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-eirini/"><strong>Eirini</strong></a>,
an experimental adapter which allowed to integrate Kubernetes as the
Cloud Foundry container orchestrator. As the project technical product
manager, I took care of the teamâ€™s priorities and technical
direction.</p>
<p>Eirini later merged into the <a
href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi"><strong>Korifi</strong></a>
project, a complete rewrite of the Cloud Foundry API on top of
Kubernetes, developed by the <a
href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/working-groups/cf-on-k8s.md">Cloud
Foundry on Kubernetes Working Group</a>. I am currently the <a
href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/ROLES.md">Execution
Lead</a> for the working group, responsible for the working groupâ€™s
feature tracks: tracking, health, and execution.</p>
<h3 id="pivotal">Pivotal</h3>
<p><span class="subtitle">Staff Software Engineer â¬© London, United
Kingdom â¬© March 2015â€“April 2020</span></p>
<p><a href="https://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a> (now part of <a
href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>) helped enterprises to
transform the way they build software to be more lean and agile. To do
this, they offered both a renowned agile consultancy service,
<em>Pivotal Labs</em>, and a multi-cloud platform as a service,
<em>Pivotal Application Service</em>, based on Cloud Foundry. I had the
opportunity to work on both.</p>
<p>As a <strong>Pivotal Labs</strong> engineer, I helped both startups
and big enterprises to build digital products using a lean and agile
process, from the inception to the deployment in production. All our
teams included product managers, designers and engineers, and all our
projects started with a phase of discovery and research. On the
engineering side, we practiced extreme programming, focusing on pair
programming, test-driven development and continuous integration. I was a
tech lead in two occasions, on teams of 4 and 8 people respectively.</p>
<p>Switching gears to R&amp;D, I worked on <strong>Pivotal Application
Service</strong>, Pivotalâ€™s distribution of the Cloud Foundry platform
as a service. Most of my time was spent on <a
href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release">Garden</a>,
the Cloud Foundry container runtime. This allowed me to acquire a deep
knowledge of how Linux containers work.</p>
<p>During my whole time at Pivotal, I was heavily involved in the
recruiting process, interviewing dozens of engineers for a range of
engineering roles.</p>

consultancy focused on agile methodologies, extreme programming and
DevOps. Iâ€™ve spent most of my time there working on <a
href="https://onebip.com">Onebip</a>, a global mobile payment platform
with over 5 billion users in 70 countries, where I was in charge of
developing and maintaining one of the crucial components of their
service-oriented architecture, built on PHP and MongoDB. I also
developed a specialized Rails-based CMS which allows to quickly build
digital content selling websites that use Onebip as their payment
provider.</p>
