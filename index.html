<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer based in London, UK. I am focused on
<strong>sustainable software development</strong>: growing high quality,
maintainable, well tested software is what I do best. I have a solid
grasp of software design principles and test driven development is an
invaluable tool in my daily practice.</p>
<p>My experience in consulting has taught me what <strong>high
performing, agile teams</strong> look like and how to be an effective
<strong>coach and mentor</strong>. Iâ€™ve worked with enterprise teams to
upskill them, to improve their development processes, and to recruit new
team members. As a member of the <a
href="https://codebar.io">Codebar</a> community, Iâ€™ve spent hundreds of
hours coaching people from underrepresented backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>Go</strong> is my main language these days, but I never stop
exploring: Iâ€™ve worked with Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and played with C,
JavaScript, Clojure, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin, Rust, and more. I have
spent the last 7 years working on Platform-as-a-Service products,
learning a lot about <a

and <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.</p>

<p>After the aquisition of Pivotal by <a
href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a> (now part of <a
href="https://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom</a>), I joined <a
href="https://tanzu.vmware.com">VMware Tanzu</a> to continue my work in
R&amp;D.</p>
<h4 id="cloud-foundry-on-kubernetes">Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes</h4>
<p>I was the <a

Lead</a> for the the <a
href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/working-groups/cf-on-k8s.md">Cloud
Foundry on Kubernetes Working Group</a>, focused on porting Cloud
Foundry to the Kubernetes platform. I was responsible for the teamâ€™s
priorities and technical direction on projects like <a

and <a
href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi"><strong>Korifi</strong></a>,

<h3 id="pivotal">Pivotal</h3>
<p><span class="subtitle">Staff Software Engineer â¬© London, United
Kingdom â¬© March 2015â€“April 2020</span></p>
<p><a href="https://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a> helped enterprises to
transform the way they build software to be more lean and agile. To do
this, they offered both a renowned agile consultancy service,
<em>Pivotal Labs</em>, and a multi-cloud platform as a service,
<em>Pivotal Application Service</em>, based on <a
href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org">Cloud Foundry</a>. I had the
opportunity to work on both.</p>
<p>During my whole time at Pivotal, I was heavily involved in the
recruiting process, interviewing dozens of engineers for a range of
engineering roles.</p>
<h4 id="pivotal-labs">Pivotal Labs</h4>
<p>I helped both startups and big enterprises to build digital products
using a <strong>lean and agile process</strong>, from the inception to
the deployment in production. All our teams included product managers,
designers and engineers, and all our projects started with a phase of
discovery and research. On the engineering side, we practiced
<strong>extreme programming</strong>, focusing on pair programming,
test-driven development and continuous integration. I was a tech lead in
two occasions, on teams of 4 and 8 people respectively.</p>
<h4 id="pivotal-application-service">Pivotal Application Service</h4>
<p>I spent most of my time on <a
href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release"><strong>Garden</strong></a>,
the Cloud Foundry container runtime. This allowed me to acquire a deep
knowledge of how <strong>Linux containers</strong> work.</p>
